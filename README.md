# Monitor

Monitoring van plagen en nuttigen in de serre

This app is intended for practical use of monitoring pest species in greenhouses.
I would like to thank Dean Attali for his excellent tutorial on which the first commits of this app were based.

Note that the present version does create csv files, which you need to store in a directory named responses. This one needs to be placed together with the app project code.

Next on the TODO list:

- instead of csv, make it a local MySQL dbase; and later a remote one.
- CHECK: - create a window which appears after you hit the submit button, as to avoid 2 times submittng the same results.
